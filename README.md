Files for modular "Nanoleaf" style connecting LED PCBs. Each triangular board contains three 4020 Side-Emitting SK6812 LEDs, which diffuse their light into a translucent acrylic cover panel. The triangular LED boards are connected via smaller rectangular connector PCBs using a system of pressure contacts and pads.

This repository contains Eagle CAD files for the Triangle LED boards and connector boards. Be warned that SMT soldering 4020 side-emitting LEDs is *very* tricky if you decide to make your own. Best accomplished with solder paste and a reflow oven or hot air gun

A thin layer of 1/16" clear acrylic across the back of each Triangle PCB prevents pressure contacts from being crushed and a layer of 1/8" semi-translucent acrylic diffuses the LEDs on the front side. CAD files for each are included and will need to be laser cut. Link to best diffusion acrylic I've found to use is in the BOM.

All pieces held together with M2 screws (10mm) and nuts. The full assembly can stand freely without being wall mounted.
