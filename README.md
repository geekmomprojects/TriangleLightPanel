Files for "Nanoleaf" style connecting LED PCBs. Each triangular board contains three 4020 Side-Emitting SK6812 LEDs, which diffuse their light into a translucent acrylic cover panel. The triangular LED boards are connected via smaller rectangular connector PCBs using a system of pressure contacts and pads.
